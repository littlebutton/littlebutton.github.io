<p class="meta">28 Dec 2014 - Beijing, China</p>

2014 is an important year for me, because of certain things I have done this year.

First of all, I got married!  Our wedding will be held on Feb 8, 2015 in my hometown. 

We received the marriage certificate on March 10, 2014. We paid a visit to Chengdu, Sichuan for the honeymoonï¼Œ and also to determine the possibility of settling down there in the future. We visited Mount Qingcheng which is famous for the culture of Taoism and beautiful scenery, and Dujinang Weir, which is known for the Dujiangyan Irrigation Project completed over 2,000 years ago.
